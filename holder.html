    The concept of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>
    has existed for as long as coloniality (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018). The two
    are
    so intrinsically intertwined - and despite being suppressed - <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a> finds itself
    constantly
    creeping through the gaps of history and bursting into current affairs. In terms of knowledge,
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality </a>finds itself a
    necessary opposition to the monetized industry of tertiary education
    across
    the globe, particularly in South Africa.

    The concept of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>, tackled
    through knowledge, begins with the questioning of the validity
    of
    existing <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Eurocentric">Eurocentric</a> and
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Westernize">Westernize</a>d knowledge (Walsh &
    Mignolo, 2018) and challenging the
    detachment of
    the known from the knower (Mbembe, 2015). By opening the <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Geopolitical">geopolitical</a> spheres - and
    accepting the
    pluriversal (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) - that have long been cast aside because of the glorification of
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Western">western</a> beliefs, will allow us
    to
    redefine the bounds of knowledge across the globe and
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Culture">culture</a>s,
    and in
    doing so we create a space where coloniality’s effects on the future become less gripping (Walsh &
    Mignolo, 2018).

    However, the colonial matrix of power (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018), in turn, finds ways to redefine such
    existing knowledge – when presented with its overwhelming popularity and validity - in a way that
    promotes the view of the subjugating power and diminishes the <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Culture">culture</a>s/<a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=minority">minorities</a> from which it
    stems.

    power to <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cherry-pick">“cherry-pick”</a> the <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=minority">minority
    </a>populations, damages the manner
    of
    addressing the existing validity of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Western">Western</a>
    knowledge. It leaves
    those affected by coloniality
    facing an
    endless influx of antagonism without allowing for the past moments of such to be resolved (Mbembe,
    2015). It in turn leaves the individual to address and challenge the colonial power matrix, and in
    doing
    so, creates <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=radicality">radicality</a>.

    In the South African context, and within the tertiary sphere, we saw the fruition of such in the
    2015
    Rhodes Must Fall Movement (Mbembe, 2015). The unresolved and untouched happenings and effects of
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=apartheid">apartheid</a>, which were so
    ill-addressed – and the colonial state of the country, which was so
    glorified –
    toppled over with the Capetonian statue of Rhodes. With the end of <a

    so, there has been a shift in the

        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reflection"></a>reflections
    on the approach to <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>.
    Particularly the differences between the opinions of Lorde and Gordon & Gordon (Walsh & Mignolo,
    2018).

    Where Lorde believes that true change cannot occur without <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dismantling">dismantling</a> the existing
    matrix of power
    –
    which is now upheld by the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=binaries">binaries</a> of <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Race"></a>race, <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sex">sex </a>and <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nature">nature</a>
    (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018) – Gordon &
    Gordon
    believe that instead of completely starting over, we should use the existing tools and create from
    them
    a large enough, undisputable <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hegemony">hegemony</a> that
    overturns the
    matrix of power (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).
    Although contradictory, both these views exist in response to the advancing effects of coloniality
    (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018).

    Despite both Lorde and Gordon & Gordon pose valid points, I find that their opinions very detached
    from
    the current African, and South African context.

    Within our context, we find ourselves between <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Radical">radical</a> <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Africanization">Africanization </a>(Mbembe,
    2015), self-righteous
    agreement with the perspective – and no following action - of Gordon & Gordon (Walsh & Mignolo,
    2018),
    all while under the rule of the postcolonial middle class who have corruptly <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=assimilated">assimilated</a> colonial
    thought (Mbembe, 2015). Given the working of the colonial matrix of power, and with the
    consideration of
    the unresolved antagonism of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=apartheid">Apartheid</a> and
    the implications
    of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Africanization">Africanization</a> unto the
    foreigner
    (Mbembe, 2015) – I find it hard to conclude a collective way forward through the repercussions of
    coloniality on this country.

    In the case of the tertiary sphere, the movement of the view of students to consumers, and the shift
    in
    focus from knowledge acquirement to credit acquirement (Mbembe, 2015), the focus on Western
    imitation
    within the African context will only cause more antagonistic results. By moving tertiary education –
    which has now become necessary in permeating the working world created by the capitalistic society
    (a
    result of colonial reach) – to a marketable product (Mbembe, 2015), tertiary institutions in South
    Africa – and globally - hinder the progress of <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=decoloniality">decoloniality</a>.

    In efforts to correct or steer away from this in the South African context – with the mindset of
    Gordon
    & Gordon – we can, as Mbembe states, “Yes, if we fully embrace our own location in the African
    continent
    and stop thinking in South-Africa-centric terms”. By redefining higher learning and integrating the
    pluriverses of Africa (Mbembe, 2015) into the tertiary sphere as a means of resignification – we can
    nurture a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=holistic">holistic</a> African house
    of thought, with a mastery that transcends the Anglo-American means
    of
    tertiary approach. By unsettling the Western idea of a single temporality (Walsh & Mignolo, 2018),
    we
    can engage in a field of knowledge that allows for the <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Decolonization">decolonization</a> of the
    self, by the self –
    with a
    means of channeling the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=radicality">radicality</a> that
    stems from the
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Oppressive">oppressive</a> antagonism of the
    results of
    coloniality – not on in South Africa, but on the African continent.

    And although I do not know, yet, how to move forward as a whole country – addressing the higher
    education system in the manner proposed by Mbembe – not only will allow provide the basis for such a
    solution to - but it will also shift the balance of power away from the <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Western">Western</a> and <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Eurocentric">Eurocentric</a>
    ideals –
    while also allowing for the knower and known to become more closely related. The focus on
    decolonizing,
    and achieving accessible knowledge will allow for the <a
        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pluriverse"></a>pluriverse to exist, and open
    to
    consideration,
    the positions of different <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Geopolitical">
        geo-political</a>stances and opinions. And there, we start to
    see how the
    colonial matric of power, begins to fall apart.
