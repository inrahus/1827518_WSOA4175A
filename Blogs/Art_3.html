                    Artistic Reflection 3
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my Internet Artwork, I spent a lot of time wondering what I really wanted to do with it. In
                    thelast reflection, I express the roots of my project, and the topic of decoloniality that I wanted
                    to deal with. I also, quite grandly, also agreed and wanted to implement the feedback I got, and
                    diversify my idea across my site and let it be used with each of my essays. However, I felt that
                    this really took away from what I was trying to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason I focused specifically onmy decoloniality essay for this work in the first place, was
                    because i though it would be interesting to specifically explore theterms to do with the topic, in a
                    work that fully addressed the topic. I had thought of doign it with the other essays of mine beofre
                    the second submission but did not feel as strogly about the way that the topic branched out from
                    this
                    essay (well, except for "Blackness for Sale" to be honest). I felt that the tewrms I wanted to
                    showcase did not appear as much in my other work as I used it more underlyingly than overarchingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this submission, I decided to keep the content of my work from the previous submission.
                    However, I changed the layout of my
                    site, and the positioning of the work on the site to maximise the effect. Absically, at first site
                    you are just presented with these terms and the title of the work. You can hover and click and
                    follow,and at some point you realise you can highlight, but the text is too small because, as much
                    as this essay was important, the understanding of the terms -and the use and emphasis here is on the
                    influence of Urban Dictionary. This part of the site, the work, is also the only text that is not
                    black, and noted to the fact that it is interactable and important as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also changed the layout of the site to black and white to keep this effect and minimalised the
                    work, as I mention in my <a href="./Tech_3.html">Technical Reflection 3</a>, to further this
                    minimalist theme. This was an active decision I made after engaging with the work <a
                        href="./Blog_5.html">"keeping up appearances"</a> and noted the effectof the minimalism on the
                    work, as well as what the seperation and isolation of the work would do to benefit it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    in my original <a href="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA4175A_1827518/index.html#Home">site</a>,
                    which I have kept to show for reference, I had this work laid out in the background - making it a
                    chance interaction unless you got to a certain point on the hoomepage. Here, it is for the user to
                    see and engage with-it is there and they cannot escape it. I also had several echnical issues with
                    responsivity because of this layout, and in terms of this, this way of presenting my work was
                    beneficial in more than one way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it is with any artwork, it can neverreally be comeplete, and while I am satisfied with my work
                    and
                    presentation and the way it pays tribute to the influences of Ying and Obadike, I am sure there is
                    much to criticise and more to want. However, that exploration would be great for another
                    time or project, and I am happy with the way my work comes across.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for the opportunity to explore this side of the internet.
