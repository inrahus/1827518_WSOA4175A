                    keeping up appearances
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her piece, “keeping up appearances”, Mendi Obadike explores the aspect of silence, denial, and
                    disclosure, not only in the way women’s stories are told, but more deeply on the spectrum of women
                    of colour, and black women. The piece forms part of a collection of net works – blacknetart – and
                    works to decolonise the online artistic space with it’s simplistic use of HTML functions, with an
                    emphasis on how the retelling of events is influenced by those with power, and in a sense, Obadike
                    works to reclaim this power by exploring life documentation in this hidden/unhidden form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the work’s rationale, Obadike expands on the influences of her work, namely from Audre Lorde and
                    Faith Ringgold (Obadike M. , 2001-2003), and the way in which she is trying to say and convey
                    something, without having to go into extreme detail. In my interaction with this work, as a woman
                    myself, I found the initial statements displayed to give off a very concerning feeling. I
                    immediately had a sense that something was off, because a lot of what was mentioned about the man –
                    his position, his power, without the hidden context, are very well associated with who we learn to
                    be weary of, but never who we are told to be weary of. The breaks between the words that are created
                    by the hidden context also create this drama to the piece that show this awfully long though process
                    of how Obadike is trying to convey her thoughts – what’s important to note to the person this is
                    coming across to, versus, what she feels might be contextually important, but also received in a
                    manner she is unable to handle or not willing to deal with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obadike also notes in her rationale how she is aiming to bombard the reader with these hidden
                    paragraphs of contextual text (Obadike M. , 2001-2003) – and I believe this is effectively achieved.
                    Although the first few hidden lines are short and sufficient – the shift from lines to paragraphs is
                    quite drastic, and what you first think is building a physical description or image of the man, is
                    starting to build a character image that is in direct relation to the position of power this man
                    holds and the perceptions of him in that society. This bombardment of information is further
                    elevated by the tone in which Obadike introduces the piece in – the way the short lines are quick,
                    and almost quiet thoughts, to the intricate and visual lines in the paragraphs that are controlled
                    and paced by the presence of commas and full stops, and the rushing middle section that shows the
                    anxiety and racing thoughts that came with the physical experience of the assaults – all this
                    elevates the discomfort of the piece, and the bombardment of emotion and confusion of the reader -an
                    assault on their thoughts and discomfort in the knowledge of what was hidden.

                    Where I believe Obadike has brought in the identity of a black woman, is in what is hidden – the
                    details of the man being white, the fact that he was also a superior in her place of work and who
                    had the power to pull her in and out of populated environments, and how, as a black woman who was
                    optimistic and meek, she tried to ignore the situations, with the fear of the worst coming to happen
                    to her and her work should she retaliate. The context of the black identity and specifically that of
                    a black woman, is well explored in relation to the powerful, older white male who has a stature in
                    society. Not only that, but in relation to the view this person of power has on the white woman is
                    mentioned briefly at the end, but with a notion of the inferior view the man has on her, the black
                    woman, and the disappointment that the roles between the white woman and her, the black woman are
                    not reversed – yet the man would never do such to a white woman, despite his obvious berating of
                    her. These nuanced notions showcase aspects of personal thought and experience, that although shared
                    by women, and women of colour, are unique to Obadike and her position as a black woman in that
                    context.

                    In terms of the technicality of the work, I believe the minimal spread of the work, creates a large
                    advantage in terms of the interaction of the piece. There is nothing to take away from the work and
                    the use of pink and the lack of capitals to highlight Obadike’s thoughts and context emphasis the
                    societal binary of femininity and I feel, targets the emasculation of black woman. I also like the
                    use of black on white – as almost to really prove the saying that things aren’t all that black and
                    white, sometimes there is pink.
                    I really enjoyed and loved the functionality of Obadike’s piece, I believe that the way in which it
                    was written and present work to further this documentation of the experience while creating an
                    inexplicable connection to Obadike and her situation through the engagement of the piece. The
                    frustrations, fears and decisions are well conveyed in this piece, and actively display Obadike’s
                    iintentions.
