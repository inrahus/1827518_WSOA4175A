                    Rationale
                </p>
                <p>
                    My internet artwork is heavily imspired by the pieces,"Blind Spot" by Ying, and "keeping up
                    appearances" by Obadike. Throughout this semester I have chosen to tackle the subject of
                    decolonisation and to an extent, there is this belief that one should decolonise themselves. Do your
                    own research, find your own history -figure it out yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The piece I have create, "The Decolonial Dictionary" is actually a bit of an attempt and satire at
                    this. By using my own essay as the work, and linking key terms to the definition pages in the Urban
                    dictionary -
                    I'm showcasing a bit of that research (but with a specific work that was an actual way in which I
                    actually showcases a part of my decolonising my mentality journey), and a bit of how easy it is for
                    that journey to be exhastive
                    with the kind of content you come across and the people who dont take it seriously and the mass
                    opinions that are uneducated. I'll admit sometimes it's funny too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This piece takes format from Obadike and influence from Ying and uniquely expresses a current
                    temporal space where the internet is good and bad and the world is pretty bad too, but people are
                    trying to just, be. The piece isactually meant to be more educational, but I can't help the though
                    of what an artifact this could become as contexts and definitions change - but the base work sticks
                    it to right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a lot of fun to make and it was a bit tiring, but I am proud of it.
