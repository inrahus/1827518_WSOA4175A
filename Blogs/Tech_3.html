                <p>
                    For this submission, not a lot has changed with my site in terms of content and layout, but I have
                    made
                    some changes to the site as an artwork, to further my Internet Artwork, and showcase the difference
                    between my previous artwork arrangement and the current one I have decided to submit. These changes
                    will however be further expanded upon in my <a href="./Art_3.html">Artistic Reflection 3</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the feedback
                    recived both in assignment one and assignment two, I noticed there was still some concern on the
                    flow of my site, but I do believe with this minimalist revamp - inspired by Obadikes, "keeping upa
                    appearances" - I was able to rectify this to a
                    better
                    degree than the previous submission - I also completely reworked my Navigation Bar to fix the
                    previous issue of thehover underline feature. I also scaled it down, to givemore enphasis to
                    the homepage content, and since it literally leads to different parts of a now very small scrolliing
                    site, it is there more secondarily now. I also address the issues with my Artistic and
                    Technical Reflections being inseperable blogs, and gathered them in one section which I previously
                    used as an "About". I have kepts the bubble style around it to still show that seperation that I
                    mentioned before, and so that it is an easy place to find everything to do with the making of the
                    site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also changed the layout of my blog cards to better fit the minimalist theme I
                    was going for, and opted for maximum image and minimal text. With the way I have now implemented my
                    Internet Artwork, I was able to completely erase the scalibility issue previously presented as well.
                    I changed thge blog pages as well actually, removed the bubble style around it and maximised the
                    background space andcolour to fit more with this minimalist ideal, and also to really give a focus
                    on the content with the simple bakc and white.
                </p>

                    In terms of what didn't work with this site - annoyingly, it is the second last blog post card that
                    is really a bummer. It happens to size differently for a reason that escapes me but overall I
                    believe it is a minor issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address again, the React.js, I still felt this was easier for me to use. I have honestly always
                    struggled with Javascript, and even the one function I have used across my site was not easy for me
                    to understand. In terms of producing the level and quality of site I have now - I fully believe this
                    would not have been possible with React.js in this timeframe with my given skills. Again, I am not
                    saying it is a useless or invalid skill - but given the circumstances of this semester, it was not
                    an option for me, but I still find great value in the knowledge shared with me.
                </p>

                    Overall, there wasn't actually much of a change outside of the text sizing and colour schemes, but
                    again, the affliations of these choices are discussed in my <a href="./Art_3.html">Artistic
                        Reflection 3</a>.
