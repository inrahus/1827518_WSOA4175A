                    Technical Reflection 2
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the feedback I received for my site, and especially my internet artwork, I knew that I really
                    need to re-evaluate some aspects of my site, and maybe create more of a flow to the site. This was
                    overall, secondary to me, and most of the changes in my site were results of pursuing my internet
                    artwork, and this is further discussed in my <a href="/Blogs/Art_2.html">Artistic Reflection 2</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In efforts to, after these artistic changes, really value my feedback, I tried to address the lack
                    of flow in my site and focus on minimal changes that would still allow me to keep my one-page site.
                    The first of which was changing my “Latest” section, to “Updated and Ongoing”, so that content would
                    not repeat in my blog section and would create more of a spacious look to my page. It also
                    benefitted my internet artwork and allowed for more of the links to be access and seen by the
                    interactors of the site, while also giving a clear direction of which works on my site I would be
                    working on continuously, and which I have deemed completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kept my “About” section the same and intending on treating it the same say I do my Site Making and
                    Internet Artwork post – as living documents that are updated with each submission. These aspects of
                    my site, unlike the content I am storing in the Blog sections are everchanging and are based on my
                    own thoughts, feelings, and the feedback I receive with each submission. I also feel that showing
                    these first on my site, allows it to be well contextualized in term of our assignment briefs. The
                    reason I chose to follow up my About section after this instead of my Blog section, is because I
                    really prefer it to be there. Although it would make sense, contextually and narratively to place it
                    right at the end of the site, I hate how it looks. That is why I have given it its own risen bubble
                    case, to show it’s break in flow, and that it is something that can be looked at later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of what I haven’t addressed or fixed on my site, this would most likely be the Nav Bar.
                    Both the underlining issue that I mentioned previously, I had no time to address, and now, with the
                    removal of the “Art” section to really implement my art idea, the spacing is very off and annoying.
                    I hope to address this swiftly by the final submission. I also want to, as I mentioned in my
                    Internet Art post, really work on the mobile scaling of the site, particularly in terms of the
                    piece. It’s a lot of playing around with responsive max widths and text sizes, so I am hoping that
                    it will not be a huge issue to tackle going forward.
                </p>

                    The last thing to talk about is the implementation of React.js. In my site, I focused mainly on use
                    of HTML and CSS because it’s what I know, and it’s what I’m good at. I have tried to follow along
                    with Andre’s tutorials, some successful and some not so successful. However, in terms of the site I
                    am presenting, I currently find no need to implement the React.js. Even in terms of my Internet Art,
                    I can achieve what I want, albeit less convenient, in a way that I understand and can explain – I
                    can’t do that with React.js yet. I am still open to the idea of implementing it and hope to maybe
                    gain insight into how it could help me tackle some of the issues I have already presented above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, minimal changes have been made to my site, but in this piece, I hope I have given more
                    insight and clarified a lot of the previously confusing decisions I made. I also hope that the
                    changes have given a better flow to the site, and that the issues I mentioned will be resolvable by
                    the time I submit the final project. In terms of React.js, I think my stance on why I haven’t
                    implemented it is clear, but moving forward, I will try to see how it can further the development of
                    my site.
