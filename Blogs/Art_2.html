                <p>
                    Considering the feedback I received, I completely scrapped my initial idea and went back to the
                    drawing board. I was still very inspired by the same works of Mendi Obadike (Obadike, 2001) and Miao
                    Ying (Ying , 2007) and wanted to really incorporate those work into a working unique piece. This
                    time, I wanted to really try and focus on the methodology presented by Ying which I discovered doing
                    extra research (ELEPHANT, 2021), and discussed in my analysis of her work, “Blind Spot” (Pillay,
                    Analysis of ‘Blind Spot’, 2021). In this method, Ying first identifies a core digital aspect and
                    then relates it to a topic, and from there abstracts it into an artwork (ELEPHANT, 2021).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, I first identified the medium I wanted to work with. In trying to bridge the aspects of
                    influence from Ying and Obadike, I noted Ying’s use of the dictionary and from there, the idea
                    sparked to use Urban Dictionary – an influence on whatever work I would make, as it would not exist
                    without the internet, and had not existed before it. The topics I mainly wanted to deal with on this
                    site were from my academic area, and particularly the relations of decolonization, and the need to
                    decolonize and create accessible technology. With the influence of, and constant re-interaction
                    with, Obadike’s work, I decided to pursue something along the line of random generated words, with
                    links that if clicked, would lead to the Urban dictionary definitions for the key terms of my
                    discourse focus for this artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, implementing this standard link generator did not work in an aesthetic manner, and
                    considering the feedback which classed my site as very detached, I looked for ways to remove the
                    idea of the work being confined to one section. Tackling this problem, I came up with the idea of
                    using a text background that the content of my site would lay over, and then using CSS to hide the
                    text and only have set responses for the key terms, making them links. At first, I really struggled
                    with getting the links to work, and eventually figured that my use of the z-index was incorrect and
                    managed to achieve the work I have up now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only major issues I really have with this piece are, first, the About section’s flex nature does
                    not allow it to be affected by the z-index and so I am struggling with the layout I want to achieve
                    – and secondly, this piece functions (as I’ve tried to work with the previous issue) mostly only on
                    desktop and larger screens. The third would be the face that some of the links arent accessibile
                    because they are behind other elemrnts, but with the repeating nautre of most of the ters used, I am
                    not to concerned with this. I am still
                    struggling to address the first issue and it is visible in
                    the way the words and text overlap, but I have decided to make the words somewhat visible on the
                    background and on tap or hover, it becomes less transparent. Although I haven’t had the opportunity
                    to test this, I believe it will, or at least has the potential to breach the mobile issue. Moving
                    forward, I will try to see what I can do about the overlap in the About section.
                </p>
                <p>The text I have used was from my first blog post on the site, “Tackling Decoloniality” (Pillay,
                    Tackling Decoloniality, 2021). Because I want this artwork to focus on decoloniality, and still be
                    very original work, I decided to use my piece and link all the words, even repetitions, to their
                    definitions on Urban dictionary to comment on the way that even though such topics are not new to
                    contemporary culture, they remain relevant, and they are seeked out by the youth and incoming
                    generations. The use of Urban dictionary may initially have been inspired by Ying’s piece, and the
                    final layout by Obadike, but I do believe the commentary that I am trying to achieve about the
                    continuous relevant of such discourse – and showcasing it to interacts stands to work as a piece of
                    internet art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although my idea has changed drastically, I hope this piece has provided a clearer scope of my
                    intentions for this piece. As it functions now, it serves to showcase the contemporary relevance of
                    decolonization, and functions as a bridging between the works of Obadike and Ying. Moving forward
                    with this piece, I think I wanted it to function more intersection ally, and by this, I mean to
                    bring in more text pieces from my other work into the layer, and work to identify more terms that
                    relate to decolonial theory in them, regardless of how few terms there may be.
